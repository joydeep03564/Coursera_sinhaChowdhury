* print_Array function: Prints the given array.
* Find_maximum : This function is also taking two aurguments and calculating  the maximum from the given i/p array by comapring each element.
* Find_minimum : This function is also taking two aurguments and calculating  the minimum from the given i/p array by comapring each element.
* Find_mean: This function reads through the array and sum it up and then calculates the mean based on the number of the element and value of *the element entered by the User.
* sort_array: This function is passing the array element and number of the element. Then performs the shorting by comparing each element and * * gives the output of the shorted array in decending sequence
* find_median: This function is passing the array element and number of the element. Then based on the number of elements. It will calculate *the median from the sorted array. If the number of the elements is odd then it will give the middle element value as a median and if the *number of elements is even then it will give the averge of (n-1/2 th element and n/2 )/2 as a Median. 
* Print_statistics(): This function is only print the values from functions: Find_maximum,Find_minimum,Find_mean,find_median;
